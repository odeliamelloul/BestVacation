# BestVacation
I built an internet system that is suitable for hosting and vacations for clients.
The goal is to simplify and make it easier for those interested in vacation to get an appropriate answer,
Thus: Customers will avoid unnecessary clarification and search efforts, and instead - after entering their requirements in the system,
They will receive direct offers tailored to them. (Of course, they can update their requirements at any time after entering their personal area)
In addition, each host has a personal area with a password (and the option to receive a password recovery by email if he forgets)
The host can add his hotels if all the criteria and number of rooms varies at any time automaticly to (number of reservied rooms).
The system matches customers and hotels, so the host can
In the personal area to see who the right customers his accommodation units, and create an order, which is made by sending an email automatically to the right customers.
In the mail to be sent to the customer there is all the data for the appropriate hotel including contact details and photos of that hotel.
Further processing of the request is done by email or phone so the host can change the status of the request in the system.
Of course, if after a certain time no communication has been made with the customer, the system will delete the order status automatically.
